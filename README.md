# Raspberry Pi Joystick Controller

A web-based joystick controller interface built with React and TypeScript, designed to control a Raspberry Pi robot.

## Live Demo

ðŸŽ® [Try the controller here](https://raspberry-pi-joystick.vercel.app/)

## Features

- Dual joystick control system:
  - Speed Controller: Controls the robot's speed (-100% to 100%)
  - Direction Controller: Controls the robot's direction with 360-degree movement
- Real-time WebSocket communication
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile
- Demo mode for testing without Raspberry Pi connection
- Touch and mouse event support
- Smooth animations and visual feedback

## Technical Stack

- React
- TypeScript
- WebSocket API
- CSS3 with modern animations
- Vercel for deployment

## Local Development

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Janhvi2909/raspberry-pi-joystick.git
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server
```bash
npm start
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Usage

- Use the left joystick to control speed (up/down movement)
- Use the right joystick to control direction (360-degree movement)
- The interface shows real-time feedback for both speed and direction values
- Demo mode is active when no Raspberry Pi is connected

# Joystick Controller for Raspberry Pi

A simple web-based joystick controller that sends commands to a Raspberry Pi through WebSocket.

## Features
- Speed control joystick (vertical movement)
- Direction control joystick (360-degree movement)
- Real-time WebSocket communication
- Works on both mobile and desktop browsers

## Setup

### On Raspberry Pi:
1. Install Python requirements:
```bash
cd raspberry_pi_server
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Start the WebSocket server:
```bash
python server.py
```

### Running the Web Interface:
1. Start a local web server:
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

2. Access the controller:
- On same computer: http://localhost:8000
- On mobile device: http://[YOUR_COMPUTER_IP]:8000

## Usage
- Left joystick: Controls speed (-100% to 100%)
- Right joystick: Controls direction (X and Y from -100% to 100%)
- Values automatically reset to 0 when joysticks are released

## Technical Details
- WebSocket server runs on port 8765
- Web interface uses native touch/mouse events
- All values are normalized to -100 to 100 range
